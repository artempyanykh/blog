    <div class="post-list-teaser"><p>“Rewrite it in Rust!” really picked up some steam and for a good reason: you get safety,
expressiveness… and often better performance too. One such project is <a href="https://github.com/uutils/coreutils">a rewrite</a>
of GNU coreutils in Rust. <code>coreutils</code> has been developed and improved over many years, so it’d be
interesting to see where the rewrite will land performance-wise.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I decided to <strong>take the venerable <code>du</code> utility and re-implement it in
Rust</strong>. Moreover, I wanted to take full advantage of Rust’s “fearless concurrency” and use <code>async</code>
and <code>tokio</code> to extract more performance in a multi-core environment.</p>

    <div class="post-list-teaser"><p>… or “the missing Law of Excluded Middle”.</p>
<p>First things first, Law of Excluded Middle or LEM is an axiom of logic
that states that either some proposition <code>A</code> holds or its negation
<code>¬A</code> holds, there is no third choice. LEM is one of the core tenets of
formal reasoning in “classical” branches of mathematics, and for me as
a classically trained mathematician this is indeed a very natural way
of thinking.</p>
<p>Recently, I got interested in the theory of programming languages. The
discipline differs a great deal from functional analysis, probability
theory or other familiar branches of mathematics, and learning
required starting from the very basics, including proof theory and
intuitionistic logic.</p>
<p>Honestly, this all did feel pretty daunting and unproductive given how
much effort was required even for simple proofs. So I figured that
doing exercises <em>in code</em> instead of pencil &amp; paper should make it
more fun.</p>
<p>Ahead are some basic pieces of intuitionistic logic accompanied by
snippets of <code>Coq</code> code.</p>

    <div class="post-list-teaser"><p>The <a href="https://pianykh.com/blog/posts/2018-12-31-assembling-noop.html">previous post</a> covers preliminary topics that include tool-chain,
compiling assembly programs and turning them into executables, a bit
about anatomy of Mach-O object files, and finally SysV ABI and system
calls.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, we are ready to get serious and solve some
real problems… like FizzBuzz. This time around we’ll be doing
dynamic linking with C runtime, using library functions, accessing
command line arguments, and, of course, fighting segfaults.</p>
<p>This <strong>is not</strong> a post about how to solve a FizzBuzz. The problems is
used merely as a means to illustrate low-level aspects of linking,
executable loading, lazy symbol binding, etc.</p>

happening under the hood are far from being trivial: memory allocation, register and stack

down the stack to the bare assembly in order to build a minimal working program (and a couple more
complex ones) might be a fun excercise.</p>
<p>This is the first post about assembly on MacOS X, that covers “getting started”, calling conventions
and system calls. I plan to write another post with more practical examples later on.</p>

    <div class="post-list-teaser"><p><strong>A functor is a homomorphism of categories.</strong>
Nice and short definition, but it made absolutely no sense to me.
At the time I decided to step up my FP game, I was pretty well versed in Scalaz, confidently used Functor, Monad, Applicative and the like.
So, I jumped into a textbook on Category Theory… and got totally stuck.
Something just hadn’t clicked in my mind, I couldn’t map the math to Scalaz code, and instead of being enlightened I only got confused.
Then other things came up, and Cats were put on a back-burner.
The issue as I see it now was in the wrong mindset I developed while being exposed only to the code and internet articles.
Recently, I made another attempt in learning Category Theory which is on-going now and to some extent more successful.</p>
