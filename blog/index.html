    <div class="post-list-teaser"><p>Can Haskell be a practical language choice for passing a FAANG-style coding interview? To find this out we’re going to solve a typical interview problem in Haskell in 2 different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>simple with recursion and persistent maps, and</li>
<li>more advanced with mutable arrays and ST monad.</li>
</ul>
<p>In both cases we’re going to look at how straightforward the translation from the original idea to the code is.</p>

    <span class="post-list-date">April 26, 2019</span>
    <div class="post-list-teaser"><p>… or “the missing Law of Excluded Middle”.</p>
<p>First things first, Law of Excluded Middle or LEM is an axiom of logic that states that either some proposition <code>A</code> holds or its negation <code>¬A</code> holds, there is no third choice. LEM is one of the core tenets of formal reasoning in “classical” branches of mathematics, and for me as a classically trained mathematician this is indeed a very natural way of thinking.</p>
<p>Recently, I got interested in the theory of programming languages. The discipline differs a great deal from functional analysis, probability theory or other familiar branches of mathematics, and learning required starting from the very basics, including proof theory and intuitionistic logic.</p>
<p>Honestly, this all did feel pretty daunting and unproductive given how much effort was required even for simple proofs. So I figured that doing exercises <em>in code</em> instead of pencil &amp; paper should make it more fun.</p>
<p>Ahead are some basic pieces of intuitionistic logic accompanied by snippets of <code>Coq</code> code.</p>

    <span class="post-list-date">January 16, 2019</span>
    <div class="post-list-teaser"><p>The <a href="https://artempyanykh.com/blog/posts/2018-12-31-assembling-noop.html">previous post</a> covers preliminary topics that include tool-chain, compiling assembly programs and turning them into executables, a bit about anatomy of Mach-O object files, and finally SysV ABI and system calls.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, we are ready to get serious and solve some real problems… like FizzBuzz. This time around we’ll be doing dynamic linking with C runtime, using library functions, accessing command line arguments, and, of course, fighting segfaults.</p>
<p>This <strong>is not</strong> a post about how to solve a FizzBuzz. The problems is used merely as a means to illustrate low-level aspects of linking, executable loading, lazy symbol binding, etc.</p>

    <span class="post-list-date">December 31, 2018</span>
    <div class="post-list-teaser"><p>When I hear <code>hello-world</code> I imagine a trivial one-line program. However, things that are actually happening under the hood are far from being trivial: memory allocation, register and stack manipulation, and interop with an OS kernel among others. So I figured that going a couple layers down the stack to the bare assembly in order to build a minimal working program (and a couple more complex ones) might be a fun excercise.</p>
<p>This is the first post about assembly on MacOS X, that covers “getting started”, calling conventions and system calls. I plan to write another post with more practical examples later on.</p>

    <span class="post-list-date">October  2, 2017</span>
    <div class="post-list-teaser"><p><strong>A functor is a homomorphism of categories.</strong> Nice and short definition, but it made absolutely no sense to me. At the time I decided to step up my FP game, I was pretty well versed in Scalaz, confidently used Functor, Monad, Applicative and the like. So, I jumped into a textbook on Category Theory… and got totally stuck. Something just hadn’t clicked in my mind, I couldn’t map the math to Scalaz code, and instead of being enlightened I only got confused. Then other things came up, and Cats were put on a back-burner. The issue as I see it now was in the wrong mindset I developed while being exposed only to the code and internet articles. Recently, I made another attempt in learning Category Theory which is on-going now and to some extent more successful.</p>
