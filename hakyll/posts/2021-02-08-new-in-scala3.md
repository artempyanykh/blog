title: What's new in Scala 3
category: scala, convo
---

This is a two-part discussion with Anton Sviridov (at the time a Staff Engineer @ Disney Streaming) about various new features and quality of life improvements in Scala 3.

In Part 1 we talk about various "standalone" features like enums, opaque types, significant indentation, etc. And to be honest this was already enough to get me excited about the language again.

Features discussed in the Part 1 video:

- [Top-level main methods](https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/changed-features/main-functions.html).
- [Enums](https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/enums/enums.html).
- [Opaque types](https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/other-new-features/opaques.html).
- [Union types](https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/new-types/union-types.html).
- [Strict/Multiversal Equality](https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/contextual/multiversal-equality.html).
- [Optional braces](https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/reference/other-new-features/indentation.html).

In Part 2 we dive deep into implicits that have underwent a major overhaul in
Scala 3. We discuss a set of new language features tailored to cover most common
and idiomatic uses of implicits.

Features discussed in the Part 2 video:

- [Using clauses](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/reference/contextual/using-clauses.html)
  and [given instances](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/reference/contextual/givens.html).
- [Extension methods](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/reference/contextual/extension-methods.html).
- [Context function](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/reference/contextual/context-functions.html).
