  Hey there! My names is Artem. My <strong>educational background</strong> is in
  Math and Computer Science, with a specialization on a branch of applied
  mathematics called <em>Operations Research</em>, which is mostly about
  decision making and multi-criteria optimization.
</p>

<p>
  My <strong>postgraduate work</strong> was dedicated to studying
  &ldquo;Repeated Games with Asymmetric Information&rdquo;. In other words, it
  was about repeated interactions between agents, where each agent has certain
  beliefs about what his opponent knows and then does Bayesian inference based
  on opponents's actions. In essence, it's probability theory and convex
  optimization mixed into a game theoretic framework.
</p>

<p>
  In my <strong>career</strong> I worked on a variety of projects ranging from
  Web Development to Data Science to IoT and Distributed Systems. Nowadays, I
  spend my time on <strong>static analysis</strong> and
  <strong>compilers</strong> trying to make software safer and more reliable.
</p>

<p>
  I have experience working as an individual contributor and also as a technical
  leader.
